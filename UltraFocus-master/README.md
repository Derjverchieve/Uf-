# 📱 UltraFocus

**UltraFocus** is an open-source Android app that helps you beat distractions and improve productivity by blocking selected apps for a specific time duration. Once **Focus Mode** is enabled, any app you've added to your block list will be force-closed if opened, and a focus screen will be displayed instead.

> 🧘 Stay focused. Stay productive. The digital way.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Launch the app and select apps you want to block.
2. Set the focus duration (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour, etc.).
3. Tap **Start Focus Mode**.
4. If any blocked app is opened, UltraFocus immediately closes it and shows a custom screen.
5. Once the timer ends, access to blocked apps is restored.

| `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` | Allows UltraFocus to show a persistent notification during Focus Mode. |
| `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` | Enables the display of a full-screen focus overlay on top of blocked apps. |
| `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` | Ensures Focus Mode can restart automatically after the device is rebooted. |
| `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS` | Required for detecting which app is currently in use and applying the block if needed. *(User must manually grant Usage Access)* |
| `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` | Prevents the app from being killed in the background by battery-saving settings. |
